/**
 * Extract the OUR "Academic Calendar" PDF into
 * data/academic-calendar-{schoolYear}.json: term windows (consumed by
 * src/lib/term-calendar.ts) plus every milestone row and official holiday.
 *
 * Parsing lives in src/lib/academic-calendar-pdf.ts so it is unit-tested;
 * this script is only pdftotext in, JSON out.
 *
 * Source PDFs live in data/registrar/ (academic-calendar-{AY}.pdf). The
 * AY 2025-2026 PDF has no text layer (image-only scan) and cannot be
 * extracted — that year has no milestones until someone supplies a
 * text-layer PDF or a verified transcription. Do not hand-type it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/extract-academic-calendar-pdf.ts data/registrar/academic-calendar-2026-2027.pdf
 *
 * Requires `pdftotext` (poppler-utils) on PATH.
